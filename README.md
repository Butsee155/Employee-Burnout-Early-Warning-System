📌 Project Title

Employee Burnout Early-Warning System
Predicting burnout before productivity collapses

📖 Project Description

Employee burnout is one of the most expensive invisible problems in modern organizations.
Most companies react after employees disengage or resign — this project changes that.

This project builds an early-warning analytics system that predicts employee burnout risk before it becomes critical, using behavioral and productivity signals instead of surveys.

🎯 Problem Statement

Burnout is usually detected too late

Exit interviews don’t prevent future losses

Silent burnout reduces productivity long before attrition

Founders and executives need proactive signals, not post-mortems.

💡 Solution

An explainable, data-driven burnout prediction system that:

Calculates a daily burnout risk score (0–100)

Tracks burnout trends over time per employee

Highlights high-risk employees and teams

Enables early intervention, not reactive HR actions

📊 Key Features

✅ Burnout Risk Scoring Model (Explainable)

📈 Time-series burnout trend analysis

🔥 Heatmap visualization (employee × time)

🚨 Executive alert logic for rising burnout risk

📊 Power BI dashboard for decision-makers

🧠 Data Used

Synthetic HR dataset (200 employees, 6 months)

Features include:

hours_worked_per_day

meetings_per_day

task_switches

break_duration

productivity_score

Synthetic data is commonly used in analytics projects where real HR data is sensitive.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python: Pandas, NumPy (EDA + risk modeling)

Power BI: Executive dashboards & heatmaps

Time-Series Analysis

Explainable Analytics (No black-box ML)

📊 Dashboard Highlights

KPI cards: Avg Burnout Risk, High-Risk %, Avg Work Hours

Burnout trend over time

Employee burnout heatmap

Risk-level slicers for quick filtering

Alert logic visualization

🚨 Alert Logic

Burnout risk above 60 for 5+ consecutive days triggers intervention.

This demonstrates business decision logic, not just analytics.

💼 Business Impact

Prevents employee attrition

Protects long-term productivity

Reduces rehiring & onboarding costs

Enables proactive HR strategy
